Passwords are, by default, chosen from the union of three character classes: upper-case letters, lower-case letters, and digits. Options can be given to omit any one or any two of these character classes. For instance, you can omit uppercase letters and digits by passing --upper=false --digit=false to mpg . This will return a password composed only of lowercase letters. Passwords are guaranteed to contain at least one of each selected character class. The default length is 16. mpg will create a password of any length greater than or equal to the number of character classes selected. If the password length is less than or equal to the total number of characters selected, mpg will not repeat characters within the generated password.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#mpg","text":"mpg is a command-line tool that generates strings of random characters that can be used as reasonably secure passwords.

Usage: mpg [flags] mpg [command] Available Commands: completion Generate completion script help Help about any command man Generate man pages Flags: -d, --digit include digits (default true) -h, --help help for mpg -l, --length int length (default 16) -u, --lower include lowercase (default true) -U, --upper include uppercase (default true) -v, --version version for mpg Use \"mpg [command] --help\" for more information about a command. Configuration File mpg supports an optional configuration file. It must be in a format supported by viper , such as YAML, TOML, or JSON; be named config.XXXX with the proper format suffix; be located in $HOME/Library/Application Support/mpg (macOS) or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mpg (other Unix) or /etc/mpg ; and use the command line options as keys. For example, this data in config.yaml would replicate the default configuration of mpg: --- length: 16 upper: true lower: true digit: true Configuration is also possible using environment variables. For example, these environment variables would replicate the default configuration of mpg: export MPG_LENGTH=16 export MPG_UPPER=1 export MPG_LOWER=1 export MPG_DIGIT=1 (To disable uppercase, lowercase, or digits, set the appropriate variable to 0.) Values given on the command line take precedence over values given in the configuration file or in environment variables.","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#command-line","text":"mcornick@macbook-air mpg % ./mpg --help mpg is a command-line tool that generates strings of random characters that can be used as reasonably secure passwords.
