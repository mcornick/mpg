mpg is a command-line tool that generates strings of random characters that can be used as reasonably secure passwords.

Please see the full documentation in the `docs` directory, also available at https://mcornick.com/mpg/.

mpg itself is stable; the experiments I do with building and packaging it are not. If something looks broken, I'm probably working on fixing it; if I don't get around to it, please let me know by filing an issue.

mpg is available as open source under the terms of the MIT License.
